# Code Refactoring Assessment

This assessment evaluates your ability to refactor a React e-commerce application to improve its code quality, maintainability, and performance.

## Task Description

You need to refactor an e-commerce product page that has several code quality issues. The current implementation works but needs significant improvements in terms of:

2. Performance Optimization:
   - State management
   - Memoization
   - Data fetching
   - Component rendering

## Requirements

1. Refactor the existing code to follow React best practices
2. Implement proper TypeScript types
3. Create reusable components
4. Extract business logic into custom hooks
5. Optimize performance
6. Maintain existing functionality while improving code quality
