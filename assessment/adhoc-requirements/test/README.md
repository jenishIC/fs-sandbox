# Ad-hoc Requirements Assessment

This assessment evaluates your ability to implement new features and requirements in an existing social media feed application.

## Task Description

You need to enhance a basic social media feed with additional features, specifically implementing a reaction system similar to modern social platforms.

## Initial State

The current application has:
- Basic post display
- Simple commenting system
- Basic user avatars
- Timestamp display

## New Requirements

1. Reaction System:
   - Implement 6 different reaction types (like, love, laugh, wow, sad, angry)
   - Each post can have multiple reaction types
   - Users can react once per type per post
   - Show reaction counts
   - Allow toggling reactions

2. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Add reaction buttons with appropriate icons
   - Implement reaction animations
   - Show reaction counts in a visually appealing way
   - Maintain mobile responsiveness

3. State Management:
   - Handle reaction state updates
   - Optimize performance for multiple reactions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Handle race conditions

## Technical Requirements

1. Frontend Implementation:
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Implement proper component structure
   - Create reusable components for reactions
   - Optimize rendering performance

2. Data Management:
   - Implement proper state updates
   - Handle API interactions efficiently
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Handle error cases gracefully

## Evaluation Criteria

- Feature completeness
- Code quality
- TypeScript implementation
- Performance considerations
- UI/UX implementation
- Error handling
- Component reusability

## Deliverables

1. Enhanced frontend code with reaction system
2. Performance optimization notes
